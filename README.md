This is a small toy project for a Twitter bot
that uses the [tweepy](https://tweepy.readthedocs.io) library
to interact with twitter.

I'm a fan of welcome to nightvale,
where there is a dogpark that is only used by hooded figures.
The hooded figures do not want people mentioning the dogpark - or thinking of it.
They especially do not want dogs in the dogpark.

This bot aids this strive for dogpark related content by reminding
other twitter users that they should be careful around the subject.
To do so it mentions them with a random selection from a set of predefined [messages](https://github.com/runjak/hoodedfigure/blob/master/messages.py#L4).
